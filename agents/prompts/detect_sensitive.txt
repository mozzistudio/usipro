You are analyzing a technical/engineering drawing image to identify ALL sensitive and proprietary content that must be removed for anonymization. The goal is to remove all identifying information while preserving the technical drawing itself.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a JSON object. No other text.

Analyze the image and identify bounding boxes for ALL of the following categories:

MUST REMOVE (sensitive content):
- Company names and logos (any position on the page)
- Title blocks / cartouches (the entire bordered area, typically bottom-right)
- Revision tables and change history blocks
- BOM / nomenclature / parts list tables
- Notes boxes (NOTA, manufacturing notes, general tolerance tables outside the drawing)
- Company addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses
- Website URLs
- Designer/engineer/approver names
- Dates associated with people (approval dates, revision dates)
- Stamps and signatures
- French business identifiers: SIRET, SIREN, RCS, TVA numbers, APE codes
- Proprietary/confidentiality/copyright notices
- Frame border labels (row/column reference letters A-H, numbers 1-8 around the drawing border)
- ANY text block that is outside the main drawing area and contains non-technical information

MUST KEEP (technical content - DO NOT mark these):
- Drawing geometry: all lines, shapes, views, sections, hatching
- Dimensions, tolerances, and geometric tolerancing symbols (GD&T)
- Section markers (A-A, B-B, etc.) and view labels
- Chamfer/radius annotations (e.g., 2xCh7x45, R10)
- Surface finish symbols and annotations
- Welding symbols
- Material callouts that are part of dimension annotations
- Scale indicators that are part of the drawing views
- Center lines and construction lines
- Thread callouts (M8x1.25, etc.)

For each region to remove, provide:
- "label": descriptive name of what it is
- "bbox": [x, y, width, height] as PERCENTAGES of the image dimensions (0-100)
  - x: left edge percentage from left side of image
  - y: top edge percentage from top of image
  - width: width as percentage of image width
  - height: height as percentage of image height

Respond with this exact JSON structure:
{
  "regions": [
    {
      "label": "company_logo",
      "bbox": [x, y, width, height]
    },
    {
      "label": "title_block",
      "bbox": [x, y, width, height]
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "notes": "Brief description of what was found"
}

Be thorough - it is better to slightly over-mask than to leave sensitive content visible. When in doubt about whether something is sensitive, include it. But NEVER mark technical drawing geometry, dimensions, or tolerances for removal.
